				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					I'm originally from East Lansing, Michigan, where I've had a passion for exploring the world of technology. I enjoy immersing myself in challenging environments and continuous learning. Staying active and prioritizing health have always been essential aspects of my life. Growing up, I had the opportunity to play soccer, fostering teamwork and determination.

My journey into the world of technology began when I joined ITEC, a robotics team that introduced me to the wonders of tech. Alongside this I attended various camps to foster my interest within technology, whether this be block-building in Scratch or rudimentary game development. These experiences have shaped my background and ignited my curiosity for all things tech-related.
